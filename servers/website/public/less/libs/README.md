Compless
=============================================

**It's like [compass][], but for [less][]**

Mixins divided into categories in a way how it done in the compass'
[reference][].  See sources to find what is already implemented. Some mixins
will not be implemented, however, because they make no sense - [text-shadow][],
for example.

To start using this set, just extract an [archive][] into folder where your less
files lie, rename extracted directory to `compless` and put `@import
"compless/all"` on the top of your stylesheet.

The main purpose of this project is to give a developer mixins set similar to
[compass' one][reference]. So, if you want to create a pull request, make sure
that new functionality as similar to compass' analogues as possible.
