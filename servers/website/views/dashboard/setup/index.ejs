<h2>Setup Guide</h2>
<span>
  The goal of this guide is to ease the process of installing <%= company %> in your website.

  <h3>Add <%= company %> DNS CNAME</h3>
  <p>
    Please add this CNAME record to your websites DNS. This will enable traffic to be
    routed to <%= company %> though your domain name which will increase the defensibility
    of ads being delivered on your website. Feel free to <a href="#" onclick="Intercom('showNewMessage', 'Can you please help me setup the DNS CNAME record?')">contact us</a> 
    if you don't know how, our team can walk you through it.
    <br><br>
    <strong>We will NOT under any circumstance use it to 
    spam or do anything to tarnish your domain's reputation.</strong> 
    We value your trust above all else, and will do everything in our power to retain it.

    If your site uses HTTPS, please add <a target="_blank" href="http://<%= publisher.endpoint %>"><%= publisher.endpoint %></a>

    do not have access to your DNS please <a href="#" onclick="Intercom('showNewMessage', 'Sadly I do not have access to my DNS. What is your alternative solution?')">reach out</a>, we have alternative solution ready for you.

<h3>You are all set!</h3>
<p>
  Ready. Set. Go! Deploy the changes to your servers and it's off to the races. 
  We will automatically track impressions and clicks which
  can be seen in the <a href="<%= dashboard_path %>/analytics">analytics page</a>. 
  <br><br>
  If you want to control what percent of your user base receives <%= company %> protection
  you can change that with the <span>Coverage</span> setting in the 
  <a href="<%= dashboard_path %>/settings">settings page</a>.
  Please <a href="#" onclick="Intercom('showNewMessage', 'I ran into a problem while doing the installation. Please help!')">contact us</a> at any time if problems
  arise, we will do our best to reach out as soon as possible.
