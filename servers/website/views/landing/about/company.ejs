    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that content on the internet should be relatively free for all users. By open sourcing our individual knowledge,
      as a society we can pull together and build the future. Advertising plays a pinnacle role in keeping this tradition by shifting
      costs from users to businesses.
      <strong>Our mission is help publishers uphold this tradition by providing tools that guard their revenues from ad blockers.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Approximately 300 million users, ~30% of web traffic, have ad blockers installed. Meaning 30% of your users 
      will never see the ads on a publishers site. In 2015, over $22 billion of ad revenue was lost to ad blockers. With
      ad blocker adoption rates growing at 41% year over year, it is important that someone steps up to defend the industry that 
      powers the free internet.
