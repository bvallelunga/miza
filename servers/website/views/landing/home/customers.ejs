      <div class="review">When I looked at my website's analytics I knew I was leaving money on the table due to ad blockers, but I assumed there was nothing I could do. Miza has helped me extract more revenue out of my website, just by dropping a few lines of code into my site. I'm seeing a considerable increase in paid impressions and clicks through my ad network, and I am happy with the results. The support team is also great, they've been prompt, informative, and are great to work with. Thanks guys!</div>
