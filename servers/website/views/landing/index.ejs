            pushes away the users you fought so hard to have. Retain
            your non-paying users. Use them as your word of mouth growth

            with Ad Blockers. They are constantly improving their
            blocking engine, doing everything in their power to
            cut off a source of revenue. You need a team that will be 
            their to out think their moves. We are here to fight those 
            battles so you can focus on what matters most.
