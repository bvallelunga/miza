    <h3>Isn't <%= company %> Protect a paid service?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes <%= company %> Protect is a paid service that is being deprecated over the coming year. The Protect product
      works on a model where users are charged for the impressions protected for their existing ad network. We encourage
      all new users to choose the Network product where users are paid monthly based on impressions.
