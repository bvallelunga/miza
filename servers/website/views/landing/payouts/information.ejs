    <h3>How am I paid?</h3>
    <p>
      After creating an account, you will be able to visit your account dashboard.
      Once there, you will have a tab where you can enter payout information. The
      payout information needed is a <u>debit card</u> that connects to a bank account
      where funds can be deposited into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each month you will receive a payout by the 20th.

    <h3>How are payouts calculated?</h3>
    <p>
      Your monthly payouts are calculated through a revenue share model.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Equation:</strong> (YOUR IMPRESSIONS / ALL MIZA IMPRESSIONS) * MIZA EARNINGS * 70%
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if your site served 1,000,000 ad impressions and the entire Miza Network (all of our publishers) collectively sold 30,000,000 ad impressions, while the total network-wide earning was $30,000.00, your earnings would break down as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example Payout:</strong> (1,000,000 / 30,000,000) * $30,000 * 0.70 = $700.00

    <h3>Isn't <%= company %> Protect a paid service?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes <%= company %> Protect is a paid service that is being deprecated over the coming year. The Protect product
      works on a model where users are charged for the impressions protected for their existing ad network. We encourage
      all new users to choose the Network product where users are paid monthly based on impressions.
