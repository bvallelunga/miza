    <h3>How do you calculate payouts?</h3>
    <p>
      We work off of a revenue share model, where the publisher takes home
      a majority of the revenue generated from our advertisers. The math usually
      works out to a minimum cpm of $1 but actual payouts can vary from $2-5 
      depending on the industry, device and geo location traffic.
