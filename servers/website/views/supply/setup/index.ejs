    The goal of this guide is to ease the process of installing <%= company %> in your website.
    Please note that the guide is a work in progress and subject to change. We will reach
    out if any changes are required on your end after the setup is complete.

    <h3>Add <%= company %> DNS CNAME</h3>
    <p>
      Please add this CNAME record to your websites DNS. This will enable traffic to be
      routed to <%= company %> though your domain name which will increase the defensibility
      of ads being delivered on your website. Feel free to <a href="#" onclick="Intercom('showNewMessage', 'Can you please help me setup the DNS CNAME record?')">contact us</a> 
      if you don't know how, our team can walk you through it.
      <br><br>
      <strong>We will NOT under any circumstance use it to 
      spam or do anything to tarnish your domain's reputation.</strong> 
      We value your trust above all else, and will do everything in our power to retain it.

      If your site uses HTTPS, please add <a target="_blank" href="http://<%= publisher.endpoint %>"><%= publisher.endpoint %></a>
      to the SSL certificate. Without doing this, most browsers will not load <%= company %> when using HTTPS urls. If you 
      do not have access to your DNS please <a href="#" onclick="Intercom('showNewMessage', 'Sadly I do not have access to my DNS. What is your alternative solution?')">reach out</a>, we have alternative solution ready for you.

    <h3>Insert <%= company %> Script</h3>
    <p>
      Paste the script before any other ad network scripts 
      into the <span>body</span> element.
    </p>
    <pre><code><%= include("../../samples/head") %></code></pre>
    <h3>Ad Replacement <span>(OPTIONAL)</span></h3>
    <p>
      By default <%= company %> will replace all ads when an ad blocker is activated.
      If you wish to have <%= company %> ignore a specific ad,
      all you need to do is add the <span>m-ignore</span> attribute
      to the ad. For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="html"><%= include("../../samples/ignore") %></code></pre>
    <div class="warning orange">
      Please make sure you attach the "m-ignore" attribute to the<br>
      individual ad element and not it's parent containers.

  <h3>You are all set!</h3>
  <p>
    Ready. Set. Go! Deploy the changes to your servers and it's off to the races. 
    We will automatically track impressions and clicks which
    can be seen in the <a href="<%= dashboard_path %>/analytics">analytics page</a>. 
    <br><br>
    If you want to control what percent of your user base receives <%= company %> protection
    you can change that with the <span>Coverage</span> setting in the 
    <a href="<%= dashboard_path %>/settings">settings page</a>.
    Please <a href="#" onclick="Intercom('showNewMessage', 'I ran into a problem while doing the installation. Please help!')">contact us</a> at any time if problems
    arise, we will do our best to reach out as soon as possible.
